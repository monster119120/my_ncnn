### This is an anonymous repo of NIPS 2022 submitted paper "Locality-based Lossless Acceleration of CNN Inference via Foreseen Output Sparsity"

Our modified ncnn framework can be compiled with original ncnn tutorial.

Please reference READEME_ncnn.md for more instructions of how to build the whole project.

Modified code mostly in examples/ directory. Please download pre-trained model from ncnn official repo.

We use ImageNet, MS COCO, TSRD, and yup++ datasets. Please download them manually.
